## Managing topics and what to add in topics

GitHub repo topics tags should contain the following:
1. Describe the technologies used in the project. (PHP, node, etc.)
2. Describe the hosting service and EasyEngine version if used. (AWS, EE4 | VIP-GO, etc.)

## Setting up branch protection rules

Branch protection rules should be added to the main branches of the project. It is also necessary to add branch protection rules when adding branch delete mechanism by default as described below, so that these default and main branches are not deleted. 

A good startpoint is to protect `master`, `staging`, `develop`, `qa`, `testing`.
Any branch other than protected branch should be created according to branch naming guidelines given in project readme.

Guide to enable branch protection: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/admin/developer-workflow/configuring-protected-branches-and-required-status-checks#enabling-a-protected-branch-for-a-repository

## Setting up deletion of merged branches

Branches other than protected branches should be removed as soon as their work is done. To setup automatic deletion of branches when they are merged go through the below guide. Please make sure to protect branches before setting this up. Otherwise it can lead to deletion of required branches.

Guide to setup auto deletion of merged branches: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches

Please note: This will delete any branch other than protected branches that is merged via PR against any branch. If you want to delete branches that should deleted only if a PR is merged against `master`. Then that will be a seprate integration. Contact sys team for it until it's setup instructions are added here.

## How to configure and tweak GitHub actions

You need to add `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` secrets to GitHub repository. Contact sys team if you donâ€™t have these.

1. `.github/workflows/deploy_on_push.yml` - Update `WP_VERSION` according to WordPress version required in project and `SLACK_CHANNEL` to channel for deployment notifications.
2. `.github/workflows/plugin_update_every_week.yml` - By default this will raise PRs against develop branch when plugin update is found. If you want to change the branch, update `develop` in the file at both places with required file name.

## Setting up slack notifications for the repo

GitHub slack integration is present in rtCamp slack. 

Guide to subscribe for GitHub notifications in slack channel: https://github.com/integrations/slack#subscribing-and-unsubscribing/

Ideally create a bot channel to subscribe the GitHub notifications of the project.

## Setting up labels for the repo

Guide: https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-labels

## Setting up depedabot

Dependabot has been installed rtCamp organization wide.

For your repo, if you are using php-composer or javascript or submodule packages, you can create dependabot config file so that it knows which dependencies to check for.

Guide to create config file: https://dependabot.com/docs/config-file/#dependabot-config-files

In case you want to update settings for dependabot or face any issues you can ping sys team.
